# HospitalFormularyPlanning
Utilized Ordinal Logistic Regression to analyze a ten years historical data with over 100 thousand encounters. 
I also explored a new R package Mlogit to build the model, which followed naturally with a three level response. 
We finally managed to give four recommendations out of twenty two medications to optimize the cost for the hospital.
